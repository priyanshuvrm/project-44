in front of Pac-Man, usually by cornering him, and Clyde will switch between chasing Pac-Man and fleeing from him. Placed at the four corners of the maze are large flashing "energizers", or "power
pellets". Eating these will cause the ghosts to turn blue with a dizzied expression and reverse direction. Pac-Man can eat blue ghosts for bonus points; when eaten, their eyes make their way back
to the center box in the maze, where the ghosts "regenerate" and resume their normal activity. Eating multiple blue ghosts in succession increases their point value. After a certain amount of time,
blue-colored ghosts will flash white before turning back into their normal, lethal form. Eating a certain number of dots in a level will cause a bonus item - usually in the form of a fruit â€“ to app
ear underneath the center box, which can be eaten for bonus points.
